<p>
This is an automated reminder that your project
<%= @project.name %>
does not currently have a "best practices" badge,
and it has not been updated in a while.
</p>

<p>
Your best practices badge entry is at
&lt;<%= @project_info_url %>&gt;
It was last updated on <%= @project.updated_at %>
and is currently at <%= @project.badge_percentage %>% (out of 100%).
</p>

<p>
We encourage you to keep making progress.
Please visit your badge entry at
&lt;<%= @project_info_url %>&gt;.
to complete the information and get your badge!
</p>

<p>
If you want to disable these reminder messages, edit your badge entry at
&lt;<%= @project_info_url %>&gt;.
to turn on "disable inactivity reminder".
However, we hope you'll instead keep working at it
and eventually earn the badge.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your time.

This project identifies best practices for open source software (OSS)
and implements a badging system for those best practices.
The "BadgeApp" badging system is a simple web application
that lets OSS projects self-certify that they meet the criteria
and show a badge.
The real goal of this project is to encourage OSS projects to
apply best practices, and to help users determine which OSS projects do so.
We believe that OSS projects that implement best practices are more likely
to produce better software, including more secure software.

This is an early version of this material;
we are releasing it so we can get feedback.

There is also a
[mailing list](https://lists.coreinfrastructure.org/mailman/listinfo/cii-badges)

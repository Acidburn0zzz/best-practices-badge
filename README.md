# Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge

This *early* *draft* material identifies proposed best practices
for open source software (OSS), including those that are likely to lead
to secure software.
The goal is to create a "badging" program where OSS projects
that meet the criteria can voluntarily self-certify that they meet the
criteria and then be able to show a badge.
A tool will be used to automatically evaluate some criteria (e.g., to determine if the project uses an
OSS license and identifies it in a standard way).

This is a very early version of this document;
we expect a number of changes.
This version of the criteria is *NOT* endorsed by anyone;
we are releasing this early version so we can get feedback.
Feedback is welcome via the GitHub site as issues or pull requests:

There is also a mailing list for general discussion:

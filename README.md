[![CII Badge](https://secret-retreat-6638.herokuapp.com/projects/1/badge)](https://secret-retreat-6638.herokuapp.com/projects/1)

This *early* *draft* material identifies proposed best practices
for open source software (OSS), including those that are likely to lead
to secure software.
The goal is to create a "badging" program where OSS projects
can certify that they meet the
criteria and then be able to show a badge.
A tool will be used to automatically evaluate some criteria (e.g., to determine if the project uses an
OSS license and identifies it in a standard way).

This is a very early version of this document;
we expect a number of changes.
This version of the criteria is *NOT* endorsed by anyone;
we are releasing this early version so we can get feedback.
Feedback is welcome via the [GitHub site](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge) as issues or pull requests.
There is also a [mailing list](https://lists.coreinfrastructure.org/mailman/listinfo/cii-badges) for general discussion.

# Implementation

We have implemented a simple web application called "BadgeApp"
that quickly captures self-assertion data, evaluates criteria automatically
when it can, and provides badge information.

The web application is itself OSS, and
we intend for the web application to meet its own criteria.
We are implementing it using Ruby on Rails
(since Rails is good for very simple web applications like this one).
We are currently using Rails version 4.2,
and storing the data in Postgres.
We deploy a test implementation to Heroku so that people can try it out
for limited testing.
The production version may also be deployed to Heroku.

Our emphasis will be on keeping the program *simple*.

## Authentication

An important issue is how to handle authentication.
Here is our current plan, which may change (suggestions welcome).

In general, we want to ensure that only trusted developer(s) of a project
can create or modify information about that project.
That means we will need to authenticate individual *users* who enter data,
and we also need to authenticate that a specific user is a trusted developer
of a particular project.

For our purposes the project's identifier is the project's main URL.
This gracefully handles project forks and
multiple projects with the same human-readable name.
We intend to prevent users from editing the project URL once
a project record has been created.
Users can always create another table entry for a different project URL,
and we can later loosen this restriction (e.g., if a user controls both the
original and new project main URL).

We plan to implement authentication in these three stages:
1.  A way for GitHub users to authenticate themselves and show that they control specific projects on GitHub.
2.  An override system so that users can report on other projects as well (this is important for debugging and error repair).
3.  A system to support users and projects not on GitHub.

For GitHub users reporting about specific projects on GitHub,
we plan to hook into GitHub itself.
We believe we can use GitHub's OAuth for user authentication.
If someone can administer a GitHub project,
then we will presume that they can report on that project.
We will probably use the &#8220;divise&#8221; module
for authentication in Rails (since it works with GitHub).

We will next implement an override system so that users can report on
other projects as well.
We will add a simple table of users and the URLs of the projects
whose data they can *also* edit (with "*" meaning "any project").
A user who can edit information for
any project would presumably also be able to modify
entries of this override table (e.g., to add other users or project values).
This will enable the Linux Foundation to easily
override data if there is a problem.
At the beginnning the users would still be GitHub users, but the project URL
they are reporting on need not be on GitHub.

Finally, we will implement a user account system.
This enables users without a GitHub user account to still use the system.
We would store passwords for each user (as iterated cryptographic hashes
with per-user salt; currently we expect to use bcrypt for iteration),
along with a user email address to eventually allow for password resets.

All users (both GitHub and non-GitHub) would have a cryptographically
random token assigned to them; a project URL page may include the
token (typically in an HTML comment) to prove that a given user is
allowed to represent that particular project.
That would enable projects to identify users who can represent them
without requiring a GitHub account.

Future versions might support sites other than GitHub; the design should
make it easy to add other sites in the future.

We intend to make public the *username* of who last
entered data for each project (generally that would be the GitHub username),
along with the edit time.
The data about the project itself will also be public, as well
as its badge status.

In the longer term we may need to support transition of a project
from one URL to another, but since we expect problems
to be relatively uncommon, there is no need for that capability initially.


## GitHub-related badges

Pages related to GitHub-related badges include:

*   http://shields.io/ - serves files that display a badge (as good-looking scalable SVG files)
*   https://github.com/badges/shields -  Shields badge specification, website and default API server (connected to shields.io)
*   http://nicbell.net/blog/github-flair - a blog post that identifies and discusses popular GitHub flair (badges)

We want GitHub users to think of this
as &#8220;just another badge to get.&#8221;

We intend to sign up for a few badges so we can
evalute their onboarding process,
e.g., Travis (CI automation), Code Climate (code quality checker including
BrakeMan), Coveralls (code coverage), Hound (code style),
Gymnasium (checks dependencies), HCI (looks at your documentation).
For example, they provide the markdown necessary to embed the badge.
See ActiveAdmin for an example, take a few screenshots.
Many of these badges try to represent real-time status.
We might not include these badges in our system, but they
provide useful examples.

## Other badging systems

Mozilla's Open Badges project at <http://openbadges.org/>
is interesting, however, it is focused on giving badges to
individuals not projects.

## License detection

Some information on how to detect licenses can be found in
[&#8220;Open Source Licensing by the Numbers&#8221; by Ben Balter](https://speakerdeck.com/benbalter/open-source-licensing-by-the-numbers).

## Analysis

We intend to use Brakeman,
a static analysis security scanner for Ruby on Rails.
This lets us fulfill the "static source code analysis" criterion.

We are using the OWASP ZAP web application scanner to find potential
vulnerabilities before full release.
This lets us fulfill the "dynamic analysis" criterion.


## Other things

We are considering the use of RSpec, Cucumber, and FactoryGirl.
